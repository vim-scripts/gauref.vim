  Gauref provides interfaces to look up a keyword in a reference manual of
  Gauche which is an R5RS Scheme implementation.
                                                                             
  You can look up a keyword:
    - command-line with completion.

  In the buffer of reference manual, folds for every section/entry are
  created and closed by default. You can open a closed fold by looking up
  it.
